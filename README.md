It can solve the PDE problem like:

 $-\Delta u =f$ in the feild $xl\leq x \leq xh,yl\leq y\leq yh$ 
 $u=fxh on x=xh,u=fxl on x=xl,u=fyl on y=yl,u=fyt on y=yh$
 
 You can choose the division of the field to operate the FEM.
 Like xn=8,yn=8,it's to divide the field into 8* 8=64 part and use the triangle subdivision.
